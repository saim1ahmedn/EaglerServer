For Versions 1.8.9 and + Eaglercraft servers


### Server supports most if not all Bukkit/Spigot 1.8 plugins. Here are a few to get you started:
- [AuthMeReloaded](https://github.com/AuthMe/AuthMeReloaded/releases) (Set max reg per ip in the config to a very large number, and turn off listing other accounts)
- [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) (Permissions manager with an AWESOME web ui)
- [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) (Since replit projects are usually public, please do not use EssentialsXDiscord, unless you *want* your bot token to get stolen)
- [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit/files/2460562) (World manipulation plugin, very cool)
- [AsyncWorldEdit](https://github.com/SBPrime/AsyncWorldEdit/releases/tag/v3.5.4) (requires WorldEdit) (Makes Worldedit faster)
